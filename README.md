# About the project
This project is a tutorial made by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1)
The tutorial video of this project is [here](https://youtu.be/bc6czIBLKTg)

The project is a tutorial about learning vue 3 JS with the Option API by creating
a reaction timer.

I also used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the first time to deploy
the website's project instead of Github Pages. 

The project is only used for educational purposes and for personal purposes.

Huge thanks to The Net Ninja for this tutorial.

# What I learnt 

I learnt how to use Vue 3 with the Options API by creating a simple project
about a reaction timer game. I used two components, one to make a block visible
to click and test your reaction speed and the other components to display the 
results.
I also used lifecycle hooks to manipulate unmounted functions along with data.
I felt like I learnt so much with this instructor, and thanks to him I will be
able to learn more about this amazing framework.
